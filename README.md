#### cmdo

A wrapper of sorts for go commands, meant to emulate the behavior of multiple executables without the size penalty
of having several go binaries for small tasks.

Non-hidden/deprecated commands added to `commands/cmdo.go`'s `RootCmd` can have stubs/shims created in a directory,
allowing them to be invoked directly. An example could be taking `cmdo foo` subcommand, and by running:
`cmdo install ~/bin --force` you'd have have: `~/bin/foo`. Hurray!

#### TODO

- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] Example commands *(that aren't silly-one and silly-two)*
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Colors
- [ ] Maintenance commands
  - [ ] Status: View list of available commands, status (installed/not) of each.
  - [ ] Remove: Check that shims are generated by us, provide ability to remove.
- [ ] Ability to force generating shims for specific platform, or both.
- [ ] Include/Exclude filters instead of skiplist.
